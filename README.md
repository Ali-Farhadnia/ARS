ARSs are part of passenger service systems, which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.

## Starter Kit

This project is based on the [Ardan Labs Service repository](https://github.com/ardanlabs/service), which provides a robust and scalable Starter-kit for writing services in Go using Kubernetes. We use it as the foundation for service architecture, including logging, configuration, and service management.
